"""RegistryAccessor — the three GLOBAL ``_lib``-direct registry reads extracted
from the Kernel god-object (``s-kernel-decomp-f5-satellites``).

``model_profile`` / ``voice_policy`` / ``embedding_profile`` all resolve a
GLOBAL Kind that lives exclusively in the ``_lib`` scope and is NOT in
``_INHERITABLE_KINDS`` — so per-scope inheritance never surfaces it. Each read
is therefore ``_lib``-direct (a caller-scope query would silently no-op for
scopes with zero such docs) and fail-soft (a registry glitch degrades to
``None``, logged loud, rather than crashing the caller).

Behavior-preserving extraction: the three bodies move here verbatim; the kernel
keeps ``model_profile`` / ``voice_policy`` / ``embedding_profile`` as thin
delegators (read by voice callers + the write-path prompt-budget veto guard, so
the facade signatures are unchanged). A STATELESS back-ref collaborator: it
reads ``query`` (which auto-stamps ``k.tenant``) through the host, so
``with_tenant`` rebinds it to the shallow copy — matching the pre-extraction
method-bound-to-``self`` behavior exactly.
