"""``dna_cli._mcp_quota`` — the DNA Cloud **quota meter + rate-limiter + feature gate**.

The runtime half of DNA Cloud metering. The auth↔tenancy bridge
(``dna_cli._mcp_auth``) already maps a verified token → a *tenant* (which data)
and → a *tier* (how much). This module is the "how much": given a tier's caps
(read straight from the ``Tier`` Kind ``spec`` via ``kernel.tier`` — **never a
literal in code**) it meters every MCP tool call against three limits:

    * **feature families** — a tool's family (definitions / sdlc / memory / emit)
      must be unlocked by the tier, else :class:`FeatureNotInPlanError` (403).
    * **rate** — calls-per-second window, else :class:`OverQuotaError` (429).
    * **daily quota** — calls-per-day counter, else :class:`OverQuotaError` (429/402).
      A HARD cap, and an HONEST one (i-050): the denied call is NOT counted, so
      the counter the overage job bills from (``SUM(calls) - included``) can
      never carry calls the customer was refused.

The counting is behind a small **port** (:class:`QuotaStore`) with two impls:

    * :class:`InProcQuotaStore` — dicts in the server process. The right
      default for a local ``dna mcp serve`` or a single-process self-host, and
      **wrong for metered billing**: it resets on restart and each replica
      keeps its own, so N replicas grant ~N x ``calls_per_day``.
    * :class:`PostgresQuotaStore` — one row per ``(day, tenant, tier)``,
      advanced by an atomic ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE``. Durable
      across restarts, shared across replicas, and READABLE by the billing job
      (:meth:`PostgresQuotaStore.calls_on`). This is what makes overage
      billing possible at all.

:func:`store_from_env` picks between them (a Postgres DSN present → durable),
``build_server`` threads the choice down, and both are selected per-server
rather than reached through the module singleton. Only the DAILY counter is
durable; the calls-per-second window stays per-replica by design — see
:class:`PostgresQuotaStore`. See ``adr-dna-cloud-saas``.

The invariant that keeps OSS/self-host untouched lives in the CALLER
(``_mcp_server._guard``): quota is enforced ONLY when a token is present. With no
token (stdio / local / ``auth=None``) the guard is an identity — this module is
never reached, so nothing is metered and everything is unlimited.

class PostgresQuotaStore:
    """Durable :class:`QuotaStore` — the counter DNA Cloud bills from.

    Closes the two defects of :class:`InProcQuotaStore` that made the overage
    job unimplementable: the count SURVIVES a restart (it is a row, not a
    dict) and it is SHARED by every replica (one row per ``(day, tenant,
    tier)``, so N replicas cannot each grant a full ``calls_per_day``).

    The daily counter is advanced with a single atomic statement::

        INSERT ... VALUES (..., 1)
        ON CONFLICT (day, tenant, tier)
        DO UPDATE SET calls = dna_quota_counters.calls + 1
        RETURNING calls

    — never SELECT-then-UPDATE. Under concurrency the losing writer blocks on
    the conflicting row's lock and its ``+ 1`` applies to the COMMITTED value,
    so N concurrent increments produce exactly N. The ``RETURNING`` is what
    lets the caller keep enforcing on the post-increment count without a
    second round trip.

    **The rate window is deliberately NOT persisted.** ``note_call`` /
    ``rate_count`` delegate to an in-process window, so the calls-per-second
    limit stays per-replica. Persisting it would mean a row per call for a
    one-second horizon — write amplification with no billing value, since
    nothing bills on rate — and Postgres is the wrong engine for it (that is
    Redis' job, and the port stays open for exactly that). The consequence is
    explicit: with N replicas the effective burst ceiling is N x
    ``rate_per_sec``. That is a throttle, not a budget; the DAILY cap, which
    is what money depends on, is exact.

    Every call opens its own short transaction on a pooled connection. The
    call is blocking, and ``enforce_quota`` runs on the server's event loop —
    one local round trip per metered tool call, alongside the several the tool
    itself already makes to the same database.

    **Dialect:** the store connects through a SYNC DBAPI (psycopg2/psycopg —
    see :func:`_sync_driver`), i.e. it speaks **libpq** connection options.
    The ``dsn`` may be asyncpg-shaped (``DNA_SOURCE_URL`` is, in the hosted
    deployment); :func:`sync_pg_url` normalizes it — driver swapped and the
    query string translated to libpq (``ssl=`` → ``sslmode=``, asyncpg-only
    params dropped) — so a DSN the SOURCE dials with asyncpg cannot kill the
