"""Story ``s-account-scoped-plan`` (was ``s-ws-plan-stripe``) — the
billing→enforcement **bridge**, re-keyed on the BILLING ACCOUNT.

**The product decision under test:** a subscription belongs to a billing
ACCOUNT, and one plan covers every workspace that account owns. Creating a
second workspace is not a second charge.

The MCP quota guard therefore resolves a request's Tier from THREE sources, in
order::

    token `plan` claim  →  AccountPlan store (Stripe-written)  →  Free floor

with the middle step taking TWO hops — ``workspace → Workspace.account_id →
AccountPlan`` — so enforcement follows the account's billing state even when the
token carries no plan claim, while a token that DOES carry an explicit ``plan``
claim still wins (the store is not consulted). The OSS SDK only READS the
AccountPlan; no Stripe code lives here.

Why the two hops instead of one: the previous model keyed the plan on the
WORKSPACE, which forced the biller to fan out one doc per workspace — and
workspace enumeration is by MEMBERSHIP, not ownership, so that fan-out would
have handed a paid tier to workspaces the account never bought.

The tenancy dimension the guard passes in is the workspace id F2 resolves
(identity→membership). With no WorkspaceMembership grants seeded here, F2 falls
back to the legacy tid tenancy, so the token's ``tenant`` claim (``acme``) IS the
resolved workspace id — and the ``Workspace`` doc seeded for it carries the
``account_id`` the plan is keyed on.

Three layers:

1. **Pure** (``_mcp_auth``) — a plan-less token has no explicit claim
   (``tier_from_token`` is None), so the guard knows to consult the store; an
   explicit-claim token short-circuits it.
2. **Integration over a real token context** — a plan-less ``acme`` token whose
   workspace belongs to an account holding ``AccountPlan(pro)`` resolves to
   **pro** caps; with no plan (or no account) it falls to **free**; an explicit
   ``plan=free`` claim is metered as free EVEN WHEN the account holds pro.
3. **Money invariants** — a workspace with NO ``account_id`` gets Free even
   though a paid plan exists in the same store; and one account's plan never
   reaches another account's workspace.

The Tier / Workspace / AccountPlan docs are seeded into the kernel ``_lib`` so
``kernel.tier`` / ``kernel.account_for_workspace`` / ``kernel.account_plan``
resolve them.
